A fully automated cybersecurity lab demonstrating the complete attack lifecycle:
Reconnaissance → Detection → Remediation.

This project simulates a real-world SOC workflow using containerized environments and automated scripts.

## Key Highlights
- Automated Red Team attack using Nmap and Metasploit
- Network traffic capture and analysis
- Automated incident response with firewall blocking
- One-command full attack–defense pipeline
- Fully containerized using Docker

## Skills Demonstrated
- Penetration testing basics
- Network traffic analysis
- Bash automation
- Docker-based lab environments
- Incident response workflows

## Quick Demo (One Command)

Run the entire attack–detect–defend pipeline:

```bash
bash automation/run_full_pipeline.sh
```

This will:
1. Start the lab environment
2. Launch automated attacks
3. Capture network traffic
4. Analyze suspicious activity
5. Block the attacker automatically

## Why This Project Matters
This project demonstrates the full cybersecurity incident lifecycle, similar to real SOC operations. It shows how automated detection and response can stop an attacker in real time.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The lab consists of three isolated containers running on an internal bridge network (`clash_net`).

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Internal_Network_clash_net
        Attacker[Kali Linux - Red Team]
        Victim[DVWA Web App - Target]
        Monitor[Netshoot - Blue Team]
    end

    Attacker -->|1. Scans & Exploits| Victim
    Monitor -.->|2. Captures Traffic| Victim
    Monitor -->|3. Analyzes Logs| Report[Detection Report]
    Victim -->|4. Blocks IP| Firewall[iptables DROP]
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
-   **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed.
-   4GB+ RAM recommended.
-   Linux/Mac/WSL2 environment (for running bash scripts).

### 1. Setup
Clone the repository and start the environment (if not running via the quick demo script):

```bash
cd infrastructure
docker compose up -d
```
